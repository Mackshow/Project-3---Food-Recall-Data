# Food Event Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed a dataset related to food events. Our goal was to uncover interesting patterns and trends in the data, and to gain insights that could be useful for health and fitness professionals, medical professionals, and other stakeholders in the food and supplement industry. We created a database using SQLite, combined JavaScript and HTML to make an interactive chart, and also created a presentation using PowerPoint.

## Team Members

- Michael Moore
- Lara Berry
- Anthony H
- Daniel Morgan
- Alexander 

## Data Source

The dataset for this project was obtained from "https://open.fda.gov/data/downloads/". It contains information about various food events, including the type of food, industry code, consumer age, consumer gender, negative reactions, and overall outcomes from the consumed food and other relevant details.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: We used Python for data cleaning, data manipulation, and data analysis.
- **Pandas**: This library was used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **HighChart**: This library was used for data visualization.
- **Flask**: We used Flask to create a web application for displaying our results.
- **SQLite**: We used SQLite to create a database for storing our data.
- **PowerPoint**: We used PowerPoint to create a presentation of our findings.
- **Bing Copilot(ChatGPT-4)**: We used this as a resource for code debugging and general information. 

## Analysis

In our analysis, we focused on exploring the data without the use of machine learning techniques. We categorized reactions based on year, age, and gender. This was achieved by creating a Flask application that allowed for interactive exploration of the data. 

Users could select different categories from a dropdown box, and the application would display the corresponding data. This approach allowed us to uncover interesting patterns and trends in the data, providing valuable insights for various industries. 

## Findings

Our findings were then presented using an interactive chart, which made it easy for users to understand and interpret the results. This project demonstrated the power of data exploration and visualization in extracting meaningful information from a dataset.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to expand our analysis to include additional variables, such as the specific date of the event and the food categories for more insight on foods and brands that tend to result in negative reactions and outcomes. We also plan to improve our app by including a predictive model by leveraging hyperparameters and machine learning techniques.
